Question:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

**pseudo code**
1. Check if the length of array is == 2
    a. If it is return the 1st and 2nd index
2. Create a object to store the key(target - element) and the value(index of the element)
3. Iterate thru array
4. Get the difference of the target and each element
5. Check if the element exist in the object
    a. If it does return the value of that key in the object and the index of the value you are currently one
    b. If it's not add the differnce and the index to the object
